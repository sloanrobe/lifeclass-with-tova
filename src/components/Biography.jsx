        <p>My mission is to utilize transformative methods to help people step into their butterfly-ness and out of their cocoons.  I am driven by helping individuals of all ages overcome barriers that affect their personal, emotional, and intellectual growth.  I believe that it is never too late to free oneself from self-imposed boundaries and limitations. I am a student of life who continues to transcend into my truth.</p>
        <p class="teacher">I am a veteran teacher with a commitment to individual success in all aspects of life.</p>
        <p>I earned a Master's degree in Education from Nova Southeastern University after graduating from the University of Miami with a Bachelor’s degree in Communication and Psychology.  I am also certified in Exceptional Student Education (ESE).
