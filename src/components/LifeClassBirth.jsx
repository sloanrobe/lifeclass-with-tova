      <h2>The Birth of LifeClass</h2>

      <section>
        <p><em>The names of students mentioned here have been changed to preserve their anonymity and protect their privacy.</em></p>
        <p>I wish I could remember the exact day.</p>
        <p>I do recall that it was during fifth period — my favorite period, which I am not supposed to admit because I'm not supposed to have favorites, but I'm human.</p>
        <p>Connection is a difficult concept to explain. There's not a clear definition of the “how's” and the “why's” we sometimes connect with someone. There are a million little things, teeny-tiny forces that we feel energetically when we connect to a person.</p>
        <p>My fifth-period class serendipitously was my connection, not just to the beautiful souls who called me Ms. Levy, but to the inner child within me.</p>

        <p><strong>Allow me to go back a bit, so I can fast forward.</strong></p>
        <p>At the age of six, I sat on my father's lap and told him that I wanted to be a teacher when I grew up.</p>
        <blockquote>“No surprise,” he said. “Whether you are teaching your cousins, friends, or your dolls, you are always running a classroom.”</blockquote>
        <p>After graduating college and working odd jobs, I found myself in my own classroom. I used to close my eyes and think about the teachers I had.</p>
        <blockquote>“Maybe I'll be like Ms. Clark. She was a hippie…a carefree spirit,” I pondered. “Or, I can be like Mr. Jones. He was modern and cool.”</blockquote>
        <p><em>Just be someone you needed,</em> my heart whispered. And that whisper became my mantra.</p>

        <p><strong>Now let's move forward to fifth period.</strong></p>
        <p>It's the second semester...</p>

        <p><strong>“Let's call it Life Class,”</strong> Bo said.</p>
        <p><strong>“How about LifeClass?”</strong> Kay wrote on the dry erase board with a thick dark marker.</p>
        <p>LifeClass started way before fifth period, but now we had a name for it — a name that would remind us that we are all connected.</p>

        <p>Gone are the days when I would line up my dolls for pretend school...</p>
        <p><em>Just be someone you needed.</em></p>
        <p>That is my purpose. To be someone I needed for someone else. To help them suffer a little less. To help them heal.</p>
        <p>To show them that they can also be someone they needed. To help them understand that they can use everything they've been through, despite what they've been through, because they can truly understand the meaning of compassion.</p>
